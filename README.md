# Building-A-Serverless-File-Sharing-Platform

### Description:

I built a Serverless File Sharing Platform that enables users to securely upload and download files through a straightforward HTTP API. This platform uses AWS Lambda for serverless compute, API Gateway for managing RESTful APIs, and Amazon S3 for scalable and durable object storage.

Uses:

- File Sharing
- Collaborative Work
